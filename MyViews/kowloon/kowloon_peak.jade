    p KowloonPeak offers four trails leading to the summit, ranging from easy to treacherous, for hikers of varied abilities to choose from.
    |Set out at the crossing of Fei Ngo Shan Road and Clear Water Bay Road. Follow Fei Ngo Shan Road til seeing a "328" mark in red, which is the trailhead of the eastern path. 
    |From there climb up to the top and then head right, crossing Middle Hill and walk downhill towards Tung Shan. Pass beneath the pylon and join the Fei Ngo Shan Road. 
    |Turn left and continue on to Shatin Pass. Take the steps on the left and finally drop to Tsz Wan Kok.

    |Note: 
    ul(style="font-family:'Courier New'")
        li The trailhead of the path leading to the top is opposite to the footpath descending to Pak Fa Lam, not Pak Fa Lam Road
        li Some paths are overgrown and beware of the cliffs
        li The path descending from Middle Hill is gravelly and fairly steep
    p
    |Summary: 
    br
    | The eastern path leading up to Kowloon Peak is well-defined. The route offers a birdâ€™s eye view over Sai Kung and you may be greeted with golden Chinese Silver Grass in autumn. 
    | However, the top stands a TV Transmitting Station and the pylons are rather distracting.
